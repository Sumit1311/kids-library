Yet another great toy for your beloved little one. Young pizza chefs will shout with joy with this wooden pizza set. Kids get busy topping, cutting and serving up six custom slices for their happy customers. Comes with a brightly colored tray, pizza cutter, spatula and a box for storage, and the pizza makes "slicing" noises when cut!! Your child can assemble the pizza right on the cheerful pizza tray. Using different types of combination of the three toppings, your little chef can make a pizza that almost looks good enough to eat. Once the pizza is "ready," the child can use the pizza cutter to cut the pizza. It actually has a rolling blade, just like an authentic utensil and since the pizza slices are held together with Velcro, it makes a fun crunching sound when it''s cut. Your little pizza chef can then dish out pizza to their customers with the included server. The Pizza Party toy gives children fun, straightforward tools to inspire their imaginations. We also love that this toy is perfect for both independent and interactive playtime, giving parents the opportunity to help kids learn while playing, too. For example, children can learn counting concepts while preparing pizza: ask them to count the number of mushrooms on the pizza, or to put 10 peppers on her pizza. Set includes 54 mix-‘n-match toppings. Six sliceable pieces served in a brightly coloured tray, complete with a pizza cutter, spatula, and toppings that store neatly in a wooden box. High quality materials and non toxic paints and finishes ensure durability and safety for your little chef!!',1,20,800);
