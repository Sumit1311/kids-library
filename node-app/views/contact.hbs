                    <p style="font-size : 15px">Your kid’s eyes light up at the sight of toys.  It seems that his attraction for toys is instinctive.  Maybe this is because toys fulfill his needs for using his imagination and his need to explore, pretend, and share.  Toys are not only fun, they can also be valuable tools to make your kid smart – and they prepare him for skills needed to be an adult.</p>
                    <p style="font-size : 15px">
                    The best toy for your kid is the one that he chooses – and it can be as simple as a cardboard box or pots and pans.  When he enjoys a toy, it provides him the greatest learning experience.  Your kid is a natural learner and anything that interests him will teach him something.   Also, the more variety of toys he has, the happier he is, and the more diverse his learning experience will be.  He may not have access to all the toys he likes, so some you have to provide some of them yourself. </p>
